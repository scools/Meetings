#### January 2021
Planning in progress, email me if you'd like to present or have ideas for this or future meetings: scooley@ccedresults.org

#### 11/06/20
During this meeting the group will again hold intentional space for discussions of healing and hope. If time, we'll also talk about the role of research in a mis-information era and what drives us in our own personal and professional work.

#### 07/16/20
Since the group last met we have seen a national wave of awareness and organizing around the state of racial violence and anti-black racism in our society. This meeting was an open-form discussion asking 1) How are you shifting your work personally or professionally to lead with race first that goes beyond “performative allyship”? and 2) How is this an opportunity to challenge white dominant values of professionalism and productivity? The network also launched a slack channel where members can continue dicussions and share resources.

#### 05/21/20
The group discussed racial equity in education in the context of COVID-19 and shared resources from conferences that have since gone virtual. We also discussed measurement and community [resources](https://roadmapproject.org/road-map-project-covid-19-resources/) available to families and students.

#### 06/20/19
We learned how **dual credit coursetaking in high school impacts college enrollment** from a network member's recent study and discussed methods and implications. We didn't get to the planned discussion on **Quantitative Critical Race Theory (“QuantCrit”)** and  frameworks that work to challenge our assumptions about secondary data from a social justice lens ([Garcia et al., 2018](https://github.com/scools/Resources/blob/master/Garcia%20et%20al%202018%20QuantCrit.pdf); [Gillborn et al., 2018](https://github.com/scools/Resources/blob/master/Gillborn%20et%20al%202018%20QuantCrit.pdf)) but check out these articles and we can address them at a future meeting if folks are interested.

#### 02/26/19 
This meeting we merged our normally scheduled meeting with a discussion [CCER](https://roadmapproject.org/about-ccer/) is having on **research collaboration** with UW College of Education. We discussed CCER’s [longitudinal database](https://roadmapproject.org/data-research/), joint projects, **cross-sector data sharing** and an few projects we’re hoping to partner on and launch in the next year. While this discussion was focused on university partnerships, we’d love to collaborate with partners from all sectors and greatly benefit the group's insights as we build out this area work.

#### 01/17/19
The group dicussed discussed team collaboration and [version-control tools](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1SAg0nllL9BR8O2Ggf6jiGwdzDK7wHVD-4tMnY-3Y3Ls/edit?usp=sharing) to improve **code tracking and replicability**. The group also discussed current projects and research overlaps.

#### 09/20/18
This shorter meeting focused on [tips](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/05/18/how-to-keep-up-to-date-with-the-literature-but-avoid-information-overload/) for **staying current with the literature**, the use of open source data (e.g., [Google Open Source](https://opensource.googleblog.com/2018/07/introducing-data-transfer-project.html?m=1), [Data Storage](http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/impactofsocialsciences/2018/09/07/research-data-should-be-available-long-termbut-who-is-going-to-pay/)) and cultivating a research portfolio.

We discussed network member's research on the longitudinal outcomes of **College Bound** sign-ups on later education outcomes, focusing on research questions, analysis plans matched to questions, WA state data quality challenges and implications to the findings. We also went out for happy hour! YAY!
